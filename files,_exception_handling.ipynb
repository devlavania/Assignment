        "Q1: What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line (e.g., Python), while compiled languages convert the entire code into machine language before execution (e.g., C++), resulting in faster performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2: What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: It’s a mechanism to catch and manage runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks to prevent program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3: What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: The finally block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred, often used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4: What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Logging in Python is a way to record messages about your program’s execution—like errors, warnings, or status updates—using the built-in logging module. It helps with debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5: What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed. It’s used to clean up resources like closing files or releasing memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q6: What is the difference between import and from ... import?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: import module loads the entire module; from module import function loads specific functions or classes directly.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q9: What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Multithreading runs multiple threads in one process (shared memory); multiprocessing runs separate processes (independent memory) for better CPU utilization.\n",

        "Q10: What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",

        "A: Logging helps track errors, monitor program flow, and debug issues efficiently—making your code easier to maintain and troubleshoot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11: What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "Use try to wrap risky code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use except to catch and handle errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Optionally use else for code that runs if no error occurs.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q14: What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Q15: How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: It uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to remove unused objects automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16: What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
