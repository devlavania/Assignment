        "Question 1: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables:  \n",
        "- Independent variable (X) → predictor  \n",
        "- Dependent variable (Y) → response  \n",
        "\n",
        "Its purpose is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable and to understand how changes in X affect Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-  \n",
        "1. Linearity → Relationship between X and Y is linear.  \n",
        "2. Independence → Observations are independent of each other.  \n",
        "3. Homoscedasticity → Constant variance of errors across values of X.  \n",
        "4. Normality of errors → Residuals are normally distributed.  \n",
        "5. No multicollinearity → Not applicable in SLR (only one predictor).  \n",

        "Question 3: Write the mathematical equation for a simple linear regression model and explain each term.  \n",

        "           Y=β0+β1X+ϵ\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tY → Dependent variable (predicted outcome)\n",
        "•\tX → Independent variable (predictor)\n",
        "•\tβ0 → Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)\n",
        "•\tβ1 → Slope (change in Y for one unit change in X)\n",
        "•\tϵ→ Error term (difference between actual and predicted values)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 4: Provide a real-world example where simple linear regression can be applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "Predicting a student’s exam score (Y) based on the number of study hours (X).  \n",
        "- More study hours → higher predicted score.  \n",
        "- Helps educators understand the impact of study time on performance.  \n",

        "\n",
        "Question 5: What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-  \n",
        "The least squares method finds the line of best fit by minimizing the sum of squared differences between actual values and predicted values.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Minimize ∑(Yi−Yi^)2\n",
        "\n",
        "This ensures the regression line is as close as possible to the observed data points.\n",

        "\n",
        "Question 6: What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?  \n",
        "Ans:-  \n",
        "- Logistic Regression → Used for classification problems (binary/multi-class outcomes). It predicts probabilities using the logistic (sigmoid) function.  \n",
        "- Linear Regression → Used for continuous outcomes. It predicts numeric values.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Difference: Logistic regression outputs probabilities (0–1), while linear regression outputs continuous values.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 7: Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-  \n",
        "1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) → Average of absolute differences between actual and predicted values.  \n",
        "2. Mean Squared Error (MSE) → Average of squared differences; penalizes larger errors more.  \n",
        "3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) → Square root of MSE; interpretable in the same units as the target variable.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 8: What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?  \n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable(s).  \n",
        "- Value ranges from 0 to 1.  \n",
        "- Higher R² → better model fit.  \n",
        "- Example: R² = 0.8 means 80% of variation in Y is explained by X.  \n",

        "Question 10: How do you interpret the coefficients in a simple linear regression model?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "- **Intercept (β0):** The predicted value of Y when X = 0.  \n",
        "- **Slope (β1):** The change in Y for a one-unit increase in X.  \n",
        "  - Positive slope → Y increases as X increases.  \n",
        "  - Negative slope → Y decreases as X increases.  \n"
