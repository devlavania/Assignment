        "Q1 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?  \n",
        "Ans- A programming paradigm based on objects containing data and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2 What is a class in OOP?  \n",
        "Ans- A blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3 What is an object in OOP?  \n",
        "Ans- An instance of a class with its own data and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4 What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?  \n",
        "Ans- Abstraction hides complexity; encapsulation hides data using access controls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5 What are dunder methods in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- Special methods with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__) used for operator overloading and object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6 Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.  \n",
        "Ans- It allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7 What is polymorphism in OOP?  \n",
        "Ans- The ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8 How is encapsulation achieved in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- By using private variables (prefixing with _) and property decorators.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9 What is a constructor in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- The __init__ method that initializes object attributes when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10 What are class and static methods in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- Class methods use @classmethod and access class state; static methods use @staticmethod and don’t access class or instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11 What is method overloading in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- Python doesn’t support true overloading; it’s simulated using default arguments or *args/**kwargs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12 What is method overriding in OOP?  \n",
        "Ans- Redefining a parent class method in a child class to change its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13 What is a property decorator in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- @property allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, enabling controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14 Why is polymorphism important in OOP?  \n",
        "Ans- It enhances flexibility and code reusability by allowing unified interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15 What is an abstract class in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- A class with abstract methods defined using the abc module; cannot be instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16 What are the advantages of OOP?  \n",
        "Ans- Modularity, reusability, scalability, and better code organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17 What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?  \n",
        "Ans- Class variables are shared across all instances; instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18 What is multiple inheritance in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- A class inheriting from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19 Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ methods in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- __str__ returns a readable string; __repr__ returns an unambiguous string for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20 What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- It allows access to parent class methods and constructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- It’s a destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22 What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- @staticmethod doesn’t take self or cls; @classmethod takes cls and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23 How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?  \n",
        "Ans- Child classes override parent methods, and the correct method is called based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24 What is method chaining in Python OOP?  \n",
        "Ans- Calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line by returning self.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25 What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?  \n",
        "Ans- It makes an object callable like a function.\n"
